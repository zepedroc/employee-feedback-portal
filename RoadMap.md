# Roadmap

## Missing Stuff

- Update all dependencies to the latest versions
- Improve ReadMe with diagram and more detailed description/decisions
  - "Usually I would add Biome and Knip to have more control of the codebase but time was not much"
  - "Emails will probably go to the spam folder"

- Add tests
- Give a last look to .env.local
- Give a last read to the requirements
- Delete the project locally and clone it again to make sure everything is working
